Example of API using [fast_jsonapi](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi), and take a benchmark to compare with Active Model Serializers(AMS)

* version  
  - ruby 2.6.3
  - rails 5.2.3

* Motivation  
  'fast_jsonapi' is very fast serialization gem. But it is forced to comply with JSON:API. But too difficult to replace all responses with JSPN:API. So I try not to use JSON:API json responses with fast_jsonapi and take a benchmark.
